BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!

- Counts the number of words and characters in the given text
- Returns a pretty print report of the following:
    - Name of book being analyzed
    - Number of words in the provided text
    - Number of alpha characters in the provided text, sorted from greatest to least instances of character count
